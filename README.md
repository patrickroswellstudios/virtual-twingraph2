# virtual-twingraph2

Recreate my Casio Twin Graph II using the HTML5 Canvas, after I thought I had lost it. The bands broke, but it is still sitting on what passes for my desk. It runs a little fast and will have a problem in 2019 as the years stop. Hopefully, it will one day join my grandfather's pocket watch as a reminder to future generations of the time when we thought digital watches were a really neat idea.

It ticks, it tocks. That's about it. You can embed this in a cordova phone app, or Mac's dashboard, or Windows tile or live desktop, if that's still a thing. You can view it in action here: http://fantod.x10.bz/2011/twingraphii.html

The JS and CSS are embedded in the .html.

I'd really love an svg version of the background image, or at least a sharper version with both the bezel and face in focus.

I just noticed the P/A doesn't repaint properly, if you let it run through noon/midnight.
